# Search

## Introduction
This project, part of Harvard's CS50's Web Programming course, aims to recreate Google's search functionality. By designing a front-end for Google Search, Image Search, and Advanced Search.

## Background
Use HTML forms to send data to Google's server and examine Google's URL structure to understand query parameters.

## Specification
- Create three pages: Google Search(must be called `index.html`), Image Search, and Advanced Search.
- Google Search page should have links to Image Search and Advanced Search in the upper-right corner.
- Users can enter a query on the Google Search page and click "Google Search" to see the search results.
- Search bar and button should be centered with rounded corners.
- Google Image Search page allows users to enter a query and view image search results.
- Google Advanced Search page has four input fields for refining search: "all these words," "this exact word or phrase," "any of these words," and "none of these words."
- Advanced Search options should be stacked vertically with left-aligned text fields.
- "Advanced Search" button should have blue background and white text.
- Clicking "Advanced Search" button displays search results for the given query.
- Main Google Search page should have an "I'm Feeling Lucky" button that takes users directly to the first search result.
- A redirect notice may appear when using the "I'm Feeling Lucky" button, but it's expected.
- CSS should resemble Google's aesthetics.
